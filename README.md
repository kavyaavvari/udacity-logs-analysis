# Logs Analysis Project

### by Kavya Avvari

This project is part of Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree course. 

## Project Objective

You will build an internal reporting tool for a ficticious newspaper site. The reporting tool will answer three questions:

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

These three questions will be answered by writing a query for each question.


## Required Software 

The following software should be installed in order to run the program. 

1. Python3
2. Vagrant 
3. VirtualBox

## Project Setup

1. Download the tools Vagrant and VirtualBox so that you can install and run the virtual machine. (VirtualBox is a software that runs the virtual machine and Vagrant is a software that lets you configure the virtual machine.)
2. Download and unzip the VM configuration file ``` FSND-Virtual-Machine.zip```
2. Download the data ```newsdata.sql```
3. To load the data, ```cd``` into the vagrant directory and use the command ```psql -d news```

### Launching the VM 

To launch the VM:

1. ```cd``` into the vagrant directory and run the command ```vagrant up```
2. Run ```vagrant ssh``` to log into the vagrant directory
