# Logs Analysis Project

### by Kavya Avvari

This project is part of Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree course. 

## Project Objective

You will build an internal reporting tool for a ficticious newspaper site. The reporting tool will answer three questions:

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

These three questions will be answered by writing a query for each question.
